# QuantaRocket 🚀

Hey! I'm KerbalMissile, and I'm building **QuantaRocket** – a modern rocket simulator inspired by OpenRocket, but with way more customization and advanced features.

Think of it like OpenRocket, but imagine if you could design **realistic landing gear**, **custom avionics bays**, and even simulate how drag changes when your gear deploys mid-flight. That's what QuantaRocket is aiming for!

### Features (Planned)

* 🧠 **Advanced Physics Engine** – From scratch, with custom drag states.

* 🛠️ **Custom Components** – Build your own landing gear, avionics, and more.

* 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built with Python and CustomTkinter.

* 📦 **No-Java, No-Bloat** – Just pure Python goodness.

* 🧪 **From Scratch Simulation** – Every part matters, down to the nuts and bolts.

### Why QuantaRocket?

Because every piece of your rocket matters. Whether it's a tiny sensor or a massive landing leg, QuantaRocket treats each part as a "quantum" of your design – hence the name!
