# QuantaRocket 🚀

Hey! I'm KerbalMissile, and I'm building **QuantaRocket** a "more modern" rocket simulator inspired by OpenRocket, but with way more customization and advanced features.

Think of it like OpenRocket, but imagine if you could design **realistic landing gear**, **custom avionics bays**, and even simulate how drag changes when your gear deploys mid-flight. That's what QuantaRocket is aiming for!

### Features (Planned)

* 🧠 **Advanced Physics Engine** – From scratch, with custom drag states.

* 🛠️ **Custom Components** – Build your own landing gear, avionics, and more.

* 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built with Python and CustomTkinter.

* 📦 **No-Java, No-Bloat** – Just pure Python goodness.

* 🧪 **From Scratch Simulation** – Every part matters, down to the nuts and bolts.

## Parts Databases

QuantaRocket comes with an **official parts database** maintained by me, KerbalMissile. These parts are tested and verified for accuracy.

There is also a **community parts database** maintained separately by the QuantaRocket community. You can choose to use this database alongside the official one, it will be downloaded automatically on install of QuntaRocket, but it will be separated in the menus to avoid confusion between the two and also so you can distinguish the two.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Community parts may not be as accurate or tested. Use them at your own risk! This does not mean I do not check them, I of course do, but I briefly look over them if I have time; but for the most part I usually do not have the time to look over main parts, so it is up to the community to be trustworthy.

The two databases are both in the official QuantaRocket repository, to contribute, just make a pull request.

### Why QuantaRocket?

Because every piece of your rocket matters. Whether it's a tiny sensor or a massive landing leg, QuantaRocket treats each part as a "quantum" of your design, hence the name!
