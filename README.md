# QuantaRocket 🚀

Hey! I'm KerbalMissile, and I'm building **QuantaRocket** a "more modern" rocket simulator inspired by OpenRocket, but with way more customization and advanced features.

Think of it like OpenRocket, but imagine if you could design **realistic landing gear**, **custom avionics bays**, and even simulate how drag changes when your gear deploys mid-flight. That's what QuantaRocket is aiming for!

It is also meant to be similar to OpenRocket for people moving from OR to QR, so that the transition and learning curve would be as short as possible.

### Features (Planned)

* 🧠 **Advanced Physics Engine** – From scratch, with custom drag states. All the physics are from scratch, I am looking at OpenRocket code and other code but not taking it.

* 🛠️ **Custom Components** – Build your own landing legs, avionics, and more. These can be imported through an .fbx file from tools like Fusion360 or OnShape, just to name a few.

* 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built with Python and CustomTkinter. The UI is heavily inspired by OpenRocket to make a transition easier or just for beginners to use easily.

* 🧪 **From Scratch Simulation** – Every part matters, down to the nuts and bolts. Every single part, be it a bolt on the outside or landing legs, everything is accounted for and can be shown.

## Parts Databases

QuantaRocket comes with an **official parts database** maintained by me, KerbalMissile. These parts are tested and verified for accuracy.

There is also a **community parts database** maintained separately by the QuantaRocket community. You can choose to use this database alongside the official one, it will be downloaded automatically on install of QuntaRocket, but it will be separated in the menus to avoid confusion between the two and also so you can distinguish the two.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Community parts may not be as accurate or tested. Use them at your own risk! This does not mean I do not check them, I of course do, but I briefly look over them if I have time; but for the most part I usually do not have the time to look over main parts, so it is up to the community to be trustworthy.

The two databases are both in the official QuantaRocket repository, to contribute, just make a pull request. If you can't code, be it no time or no knowledge, that is perfectly fine, feel free to make a suggestion in the Issues section.

### Why QuantaRocket?

Because every piece of your rocket matters. Whether it's a tiny sensor or a massive landing leg, QuantaRocket treats each part as a "quantum" of your design, hence the name! The whole point to choose QuantaRocket is that it is meant to be a more advanced rocket simulator than others. Meant for more advanced designs like active controlled rockets, powered vertical landing rockets, or even rockets with airbrakes. We want to add the most support for these kinds of rockets to make it easy for many people to use and simulate advanced amateur mdoel rockets.
